    <h4>Tasty Honey Glazed Salmon</h4>
    <h4>ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Salmon: We prefer wild-caught salmon, which has more nutrients and lower in contaminants than farmed, but Atlantic salmon is perfectly fine. Either fresh or frozen (and thawed) work great for this recipe. Purchase fillets that are boneless, bright pink, and have a nice marbling to them. Keep the skin on for this recipe.</li>
        <li>Butter and Olive oil: These start the dish off in a hot skillet, adding richness and help keep the salmon moist.</li>
        <li>Honey: A key ingredient for sweetness and needed to produce the caramelized exterior on the fish.</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce: Gives a hint of rich, salty umami flavor that balances out the sweet honey. I recommend using low sodium.</li>
        <li>Garlic: For flavor and aromatics. Use fresh for optimal results.</li>
        <li>Chili garlic sauce: This provides a perfect touch of heat, without making the dish spicy.</li>
        <li>Lemon juice: Adds a nice bright, citrusy component to the sauce.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Coarse salt, pepper, smoked paprika, and onion powder season the filets and bring all the flavors together.</li>
        <li>Scallions: Provides a subtle peppery, onion flavor. Itâ€™s a great finishing touch that compliments salmon really well.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <ls>Season the salmon fillets. Pat the fish dry, then combine the seasonings and sprinkle on top of the fillets.</ls>
        <ls>Add sauce to pan. Warm butter and oil in a nonstick oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat, then stir in garlic, water, soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, lemon juice, and honey just until heated through.</ls>
        <ls>Pan sear salmon. Add salmon to the skillet, skin side down and cook for 3 minutes, basting frequently with the sauce, spooning it over the top of the fish.</ls>
        <ls>Broil. Transfer the skillet to a preheated broiler on the middle rack and broil for 5-6 minutes, basting with the sauce once, until the salmon is caramelized and cooked through.</ls>
    </ol>
    <p>Ready for the absolute best salmon recipe ever? This Honey Glazed Salmon is it!! Fresh fish filets are perfectly seasoned, quickly pan seared and basted in an incredible honey, garlic sauce infused with a little soy sauce and citrus, then popped under the broiler to finish caramelizing until moist and flaky.</p>
